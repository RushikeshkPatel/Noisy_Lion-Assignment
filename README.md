# Noisy_Lion-Assignment




## First Task

1) This is a Data Analysis project, here I want to create drop down based on shirt type, colour, size and season and that drop down should be interactive with Resource, Hourly cost, Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Round 4, Service cost and Total cost.
In short, when user changes shirt type, colour, size, season options then empty Cells should fill with their corresponding data.

2)	Here, we can see that T shirt is selected from the option and then data is changed to their corresponding values, so this was the project, I have use Index function and formula to bring certain value from data sheet, here the data sheet is in different excel sheet, basically I have linked the data sheet with this sheet. When we select proper data from drop down than the value occurs and easily, we get accurate data.
